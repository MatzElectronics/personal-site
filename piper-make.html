                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/make-products.png"/>
                    <p><a href="https://make.playpiper.com/" target="_blank">Piper Make</a> is the largest and longest project I've been involved with. I'm proud of the work I've done on it and of my coworkers and collaborating contractors' work, too. It's a fantastic product that is already making a difference in classrooms around the world.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/make-site.png"/>
                    
                    <h3>The History of Piper Make</h3>
                    <p>Piper Learning is famous for the wooden Raspberry Pi computer that you build yourself. On its own, it's an incredible product. I first met the Piper team at ISTE in Denver, Colorado, while working at Parallax Inc. Our booth was across the aisle from theirs.</p>
                    <p>We had a great time and some great conversations, and at the time, I figured that, at most, I might bump into them again at another trade show. Fast forward a few years - I had since left Parallax and reconnected with Piper Learning. At first, I worked with them to create a few educational resources. I then helped with their e-commerce site and eventually began working on something called the "Command Center," an Arduino-powered game controller.</p>
                    <p>The genesis of the Command Center happened before I started working for them. But even then, it was always sold as a "BETA," and whatever came next would be based on it.</p>
                    
                    <h4>PiperLab</h4>
                    <p>Along with a few other Piper engineers, we focused on developing a new platform and product called PiperLab. Despite being almost production-ready, this early iteration of what would become Piper Make was never released.</p>
                    <p>We replaced the Arduino with an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800" target="_blank">Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4</a>. We built up an entire platform around Blockly and CircuitPython, and I developed a novel method for programming the microcontroller module directly from the browser. I also developed a means for routing the incoming serial stream to do more than show things in the terminal - but more on the details later.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Out of Nowhere...The Pi Pico!</h4>
                    <p>Piper's products had long been built on the Raspberry Pi platform, starting with their flagship Piper Computer Kit. While other microcontrollers like Adafruit's ItsyBitsy were awesome, Piper's close partnership with Raspberry Pi was always a powerful part of their brand and something we were happy to continue in this new project.</p>
                    <p>When Raspberry Pi introduced the RP2040 and the Pico in January 2021, it took the maker community by storm. When I told Chris Bouman, Piper's COO, that I thought we could re-tool PiperLab to work with the Pico, he was excited by the possibility.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/pi-pico.webp"/>
                    <p>By the end of February, the project had fully pivoted to using the Pico and getting away from the game controller concept in favor of a simpler breadboarded "maker's kit." It was also branded under a new name: Piper Make.</p>
                    <p>Because we were so close, the goal was to launch it on Pi Day (March 14th) 2021, and we managed to pull that off, too!</p>

                    <h3>Some Good Press</h3>
                    <p>The product got some good press out of the gate, which was personally validating!</p>

                    <h3>The Monthly Maker&apos;s Club</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="https://www.playpiper.com/products/piper-make-starter-expedition-kit" target="_blank">Piper Make Starter Kit</a>, which includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Large Breadboard with Laser Cut, Laser Etched Wood Base</li>
                        <li>Jumper Wires (10 - M2M)</li>
                        <li>Resistors (10)</li>
                        <li>Tactile Buttons (3)</li>
                        <li>LEDs (5)</li>
                        <li>Micro-USB to USB-A cable</li>
                        <li>Piper Make Stickers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>is the flagship product, and the Monthly Maker's Club was a subscription-based service where we sent a new product with at least 1 (usually 2 or 3) project to accompany that product. It was, to be honest, a brutal schedule to keep, and I was happy when we made it through that 12-month commitment. I designed each kit and wrote the accompanying tutorials while teaching full-time. On Piper's end, it was a small team doing the production, sales, and marketing, and looking back on it, we pulled off a miracle every month.</p>
                    <p>The upside of the Monthly Maker's Club is that it forced us to grow the product line quickly. Some of the monthly kits became permanent products, and others were revised into even better standalone products.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Current Product Line</h3>
                    <p>The Piper Make Product Line has grown to include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Starter Kit</li>
                        <li>Game Controller</li>
                        <li>Sensor Explorer (This is a kit for the Piper Computer that is also compatible with Piper Make.)</li>
                        <li>Light Show</li>
                        <li>Beam Break</li>
                        <li>Motion Ball</li>
                        <li>Solar House</li>
                        <li>Soil Sensor</li>
                        <li>Robotic Rover</li>
                        <li>Robotic Walker</li>
                        <li>Heart Rate Sensor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/make-kits.png"/>
                    <p>Since March 2021, I have designed each one of the kits. First, I work with the Piper team to come up with ideas, and then I design a prototype in CAD that they can cut out using their on-site laser cutters. From there, we do a few design reviews to work out the kinks, branding, and production.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/cad-designs.png"/>

                    <p>Once a kit is ready for production, one of the Piper team members or I write a tutorial or two for it.</p>
                    <p>As for graphics, Shree Bose designs the "blueprints," which are kid-friendly assembly instructions, along with the homepage graphics to incorporate it into the story arc that makes Piper Make so engaging.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/beam-break-blueprint.png"/>
                    <p>I create all of the diagrams and educational graphics within the tutorial using Inkscape. We publish them as SVGs, so they scale cleanly, and students can zoom into any of them if necessary.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/stoplight_2_circuit.svg"/>
                    
                    <h3>The Software Magic</h3>
                    <p>The timing of Piper Make's release corresponded with the release of a Chrome browser feature that makes it possible: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API" target="_blank"><strong>Web-serial</strong></a>. I wish every modern browser would implement it, but so far, Chromium-based browsers are the only ones that do.</p>
                    <p>Deciding to leverage Web-serial and require users to use Chrome (or Edge or Opera) was a calculated choice. When your development team is one part-time person and the occasional few hours from another contractor here or there, you do what you can. Given our available resources, developing an application/extension/client-agent was not possible.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Web-serial + CircuitPython + Paste-mode = 💕</h4>
                    <p>Web-serial is a cool technology. It's an extension of Web-USB and allows any serial device (think Arduino, Micro:bit, Pi Pico, ESP32, etc.) to communicate directly with the Javascript on a web page. It relies on promises and streams but is fairly easy to implement. <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/web-serial#0" target="_blank">Google created a really good primer on it here.</a></p>
                    <p>The second technology that makes this all work is Adafruit's <a href="https://circuitpython.org/" target="_blank">CircuitPython</a> - specifically, the <a href="https://codewith.mu/en/tutorials/1.2/repl" target="_blank">REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)</a>. Essentially, you can terminal into the serial device, type Python code right into the terminal, and when you press enter, it runs the code you just typed!</p>
                    <p>We knew we wanted this to be kid-friendly, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly" target="_blank">Google's Blockly</a> is a great, open-source tool to help kids learn to program. And you can get Blockly to generate nearly any kind of code you want - including Python.</p>
                    <p>The trick was to get the Blockly-generated code "typed" into the serial terminal (or, more accurately, the serial stream). After banging my head on the table for a few days and obsessing over line breaks, carriage returns, and tabs - I decided to RTFM (read the effin' manual).</p>
                    <p>That's when I stumbled across <strong>Paste Mode</strong>. You can find it in MicroPython's documentation <a href="https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/repl.html" target="_blank">here</a>. CiruitPython is a fork of MicroPython, so they share many of the same core behaviors, paste-mode being one of them. And that's what we needed to get this all to work!</p>
                    
                    <h4>What it looks like in JavaScript</h4>
                    <p>This isn't all of it, but there are three important parts to the serial connection in the browser. This first part is what I could best describe as the handshake, where the connection is established. The things worth noting are the delays, which help ensure things don't talk over each other, and the use of ASCII 3, 4, and 5 (Control-C, Control-D, and Control-E). These toggle the REPL and Paste Mode when done in the correct order and at the appropriate time.</p>

                    <p>Sending a stream to the browser is something I worked with on <a href="https://solo.parallax.com/" target="_blank">Parallax's BlocklyProp</a>, and I learned on that project that it's too easy for users to crush the browser with a massive stream of characters, which all but locks up the browser.</p>
                    <p>On the BlocklyProp project, I implemented a watchdog that monitors the stream's character rate. If it's too high, it shuts down the connection and warns the user. Since it worked so well on that system, I implemented it in Piper Make as well:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
async function readLoop() {

    // Used to track how frequently characters are received to prevent lock-ups and slow-downs
    let receiveTimestamp = performance.now();
    let receiveCounter = 0;

    while (true) {

        const { value, done } = await serialConnection.reader.read();

        if (value) {
            // buffer characters to watch for errors and count incoming characters
            serialConnection.buffer += value.replace(/[^>=\n\rEro:]*/g, '');
            receiveCounter += value.length;

            if (serialConnection.charRateCheck) {
                // calculate the number of characters received each millisecond.
                let timeNow = performance.now();
                let timeDifference = timeNow - receiveTimestamp;

                // check every second to see if too many characters are coming in
                if (timeDifference > 1000) {
                    let receiveFrequency = receiveCounter/timeDifference;

                    receiveTimestamp = timeNow;
                    receiveCounter = 0;
                    
                    // If too many characters are coming in (rate is too high), 
                    // close the connection before something really goes wrong and alert the user.
                    if (receiveFrequency > 5) {
                        serialConnection.overflowConnectionCloser('characters');
                    }
                }
            }

            // only display to the console when running
            if (serialConnection.currentState === 'RUNNING' || serialConnection.showVerbose) {
                term.display(value);
            }
        }

        if (done) {
            serialConnection.reader.releaseLock();
            setConnectionButtonsState(false);
            serialConnection.currentState = 'NONE';
            break;
        }
    }

                    <p>Next, I implemented a sort of "routing markup" within the serial stream sent from the Pi Pico to the browser allowing us to add commands where the Pico could trigger behaviors on the browser. This is how we implemented many of the features that already exist on the Piper Computer Kit.</p>
                    <p>We created commands such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>System: allows for reading firmware version, installed CircuitPython libraries to see if updates are necessary</li>
                        <li>Shout: displays large text promptly in the center of the screen</li>
                        <li>Sound: play sound clips or synthesized notes (using Tone.js)</li>
                        <li>Graph: display data in a graph</li>
                        <li>Digital View: shows the pin or LED state (digital or analog) in real-time:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/digital-view.png"/>
                    <p>When a "marked" packet comes through the serial stream, the information is routed elsewhere depending on the command instead of being sent to the terminal. This allowed me to add a ton of features and interactivity to the platform.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Story Mode - Where We are Going from Here</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://www.shreebose.com/" target="_blank">Shree</a> is one of Piper's founders and Piper's Co-CEO, and she's maintained a vision for Piper Make and Piper as a whole that our products will engage kiddos through the power of stories. The Piper Computer Kit does much of that using Minecraft Raspberry Pi Edition.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Piper Make&apos;s Missing Piece</h4>
                    <p>Piper Make is incredibly cool, but it was missing something. <em>Immersing kids in the story.</em></p>
                    <p>In December 2022, Shree asked if I could add something to the Getting Started tutorial of Piper Make: an immersive story element.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Building a World</h4>
                    <p>Piper Make has always had a story: Piperbot, the lead character, is a robot humans send to explore Mars. When Piperbot gets there, he meets Pip, a small mouse-like martian creature who helps Piperbot out on their adventures together on Mars. It's a fun story and a neat way to tie everything together, but Piper Make wasn't <em>immersing</em> kids in that story.</p>
                    <p>The first lesson on both Piper Make and the original Piper Computer Kit asks the user to touch two wires together, and something happens when they do. On the Piper Computer Kit, the user sees a world and can move their character through it by touching the wires together. In comparison, Piper Make explained electricity and showed a GIF of current running through a wire. Admittedly, less exciting.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of Piper Make's development, Piper commissioned a series of video clips to use as intros and outros for each of the tutorials in Piper Make. They showed kids the Piper Make world, but we wanted to bring kids into the world of those video clips as Piperbot and Pip explored Mars together. So, just like on the Piper Computer Kit, we set out to create that world.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Capturing Virtual World Magic</h4>
                    <p>From the beginning, Piper has long drawn inspiration from the most engaging game out there for kids - Minecraft. However, Piper Computer Kits and Piper Make are not official Minecraft products and are not approved by or associated with Mojang or Microsoft. The Raspberry Pi Edition of Minecraft by the Raspberry Pi Foundation is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which allowed the Piper Computer Kit to use the powerful interface to engage kiddos. But Piper Make, restricted to the browser, didn't have this luxury - so we had to figure out another way to bring the magic of virtual worlds to life.</p>
                    <p>I was already familiar with <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a> from using it to develop simulations to teach science concepts. I knew we could use it to generate the immersive experience we needed for Piper Make. I also knew that we had worked with an animator/modeler who might still have the 3D assets he used to create the original intro and outro videos, so we contacted him.</p>
                    
                    <h4>He did not have the files :(</h4>
                    <p>Go figure. Video content can take up a TON of memory and disk space, so I do not blame him for deleting most of what he had done.</p>
                    <p>He could send us a few assets - not a lot, but enough for me to download <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> and go spelunking.</p>
                    <p>First off - mad props to all of you 3D animators out there. I respected what you did before; now I <em>really</em> appreciate what you do! Next off, I figured a few things out. I learned that you can export the things you create in Blender in GLTF format, and those files can be imported by Three.js (mostly). Additionally, I (more accurately, my daughter - yes, she was paid for her contribution) could also use Minecraft: Education Edition to build the buildings and environments. Those models could then be exported and directly read by Three.js as well.</p>

                    <p>We've published the new version of <strong>Getting Started</strong>, where touching two wires together helps Piperbot move forward:</p>

                    <p>Next up is helping Pip light an LED so that Piperbot can land on Mars:</p>

                    <p>I'm excited to begin this next chapter in Piper Make's story!</p>
