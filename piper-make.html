                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/make-products.png"/>
                    <p><a href="https://make.playpiper.com" target="_blank">Piper Make</a> is the largest and longest project I've ever been involved with. I'm proud of the work I've done on it and I'm proud of my coworkers and collaborating contractors work too.  It's an amazing product that is already making a difference in classrooms around the world.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/make-site.png"/>
                    <h3>The History of Piper Make</h3>
                    <p>Piper Learning is famous for the wooden Raspberry Pi computer that you build yourself.  On it's own, that's an amazing product too.  I first met the Piper team at ISTE in Denver Colorado when I was working at Parallax Inc.  Our booth was right across the aisle from theirs.</p>
                    <p>We had a great time and some great conversations, and at the time, I figured that at most, I might bump into them again at another trade show.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward a few years later - I had since left Parallax and reconnected with Piper Learning.  At first, I worked with them to create a few educational resources.  I then helped with a few things on their e-commerce site, and eventually began working on something called the "Command Center", which was an Arduino-powered game controller.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/command-center.webp"/>
                    <p>The genesis of the Command Center happened before I started working for them.  But even then, it was always sold as a "BETA", and whatever came next was going to be based on it.</p>
                    <h4>PiperLab</h4>
                    <p>Along with another hardware engineer who was a friend of the CEO, another software developer who had worked with Piper much longer than I had, and Piper's chief of product and design, I led the software development that lasted a good 6 months.  We made a product and a platform that we called <b>PiperLab</b>. We came really close to releasing it as a product.</p>
                    <p>We replaced the Arduino with an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800" target="_blank" >Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4</a>, and built up an entire platform around Blockly and CircuitPython, and I developed a novel method for programming the microcontroller module directly from the browser.  I also developed a means for routing the incoming serial stream to do more than just show things in the terminal - but more on the details later in the post ;)</p>
                    <h4>And then...</h4>
                    <p>As a contractor, I still don't know much about the details, but the funding for development dried up and Piper suspended it in November of 2020.</p>
                    <h4>Out of Nowhere...The Pi Pico!</h4>
                    <p>Piper's entire company was built on top of the Raspberry Pi.  I think using the ItsyBitsy from Adafruit was less than ideal.  This isn't because they had a problem with it or with Adafruit, but because they had a <em>relationship</em> with the Raspberry Pi Foundation.</p>
                    <p>When Raspberry Pi introduced the RP2040 and the Pico in January 2021, it took the maker community by storm, and when I told Piper's COO that I thought we could re-tool PiperLab to work with the Pico, he was excited about that possibility.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/pi-pico.webp"/>
                    <p>By the end of February, the project was fully resurrected - and by "fully", I mean I was the sole developer getting it working and one of Piper's founders, Shree, was making some graphics for it and giving me some direction on branding it under a new name: Piper Make.</p>
                    <p>Because we were so close, the goal was to launch it on Pi Day (March 14th) 2021, and we managed to pull that off, too!</p>

                    <h3>Some Good Press</h3>
                    <p>Out of the gate, the product got some good press, which was personally validating!</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>The Monthly Maker's Club</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="https://www.playpiper.com/products/piper-make-starter-expedition-kit" target="_blank">Piper Make Starter Kit</a>, which includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Large Breadboard with Laser Cut, Laser Etched Wood Base
                        <li>Jumper Wires (10 - M2M)</li>
                        <li>Resistors (10)</li>
                        <li>Tactile Buttons (3)</li>
                        <li>LEDs (5)</li>
                        <li>Micro-USB to USB-A cable</li>
                        <li>Piper Make Stickers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>is the flagship product, and the Monthly Maker's Club was a subscription-based service where we would send a new product with at least 1 (and usually 2 or 3) projects to accompany that product.  It was, to be honest, a brutal schedule to keep, and I was happy when we made it through that 12 month commitment.  I was designing each kit and writing the accompanying tutorials, all while teaching full time.  On Piper's end, it was a small team doing the production, sales, and marketing - and looking back on it we pulled off a miracle every month.</p>
                    <p>The upside of the Monthly Maker's Club is that it forced us to grow the product line quickly.  Some of the monthly kits became permanent products, and others were revised into even better standalone products.</p>
                    <h3>Current Product Line</h3>
                    <p>The Piper Make Product Line has grown to include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Starter Kit</li>
                        <li>Game COntroller</li>
                        <li>Sensor Explorer (this is a kit for the Piper Computer that is also compatible with Piper Make)</li>
                        <li>Light Show (Another Piper Computer accessory that works with Piper Make)</li>
                        <li>Beam Break</li>
                        <li>Motion Ball</li>
                        <li>Solar House</li>
                        <li>Soil Sensor</li>
                        <li>Robotic Rover</li>
                        <li>Robotic Walker</li>
                        <li>Heart Rate Sensor</li>
                        <li>Windmill (not released yet)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/make-kits.png"/>
                    <p>Since March of 2021, I have designed each one of the kits.  I work with the Piper team to come up with ideas, then I design a prototype in CAD that they can cut out using their on-site laser cutters.  From there, we do a few design reviews to work out the kinks, branding, and production.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/cad-designs.png"/>

                    <p>Once a kit is good to go for production, I or one of the Piper team members writes a tutorial or two for it.</p>
                    <p>As for graphics, Shree designs the "blueprints", which are kid-friendly assembly instructions along with the homepage graphics to incorporate it into the story arc that makes Piper Make so engaging.</p>
                    <p>I create all of the diagrams and educational graphics within the tutorial using Inkscape.  We publish them as SVGs so that they scale cleanly and students can zoom into any of them if necessary.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/stoplight_2_circuit.svg"/>
                    <h3>The Software Magic</h3>
                    <p>The timing of Piper Make's release happened to correspond with the release of a Chrome browser feature that makes it possible: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API" target="_blank"><b>Web-serial</b></a>.  I wish that every modern browser would implement it, but so far Chromium-based browsers are the only ones that do.</p>
                    <p>Deciding to leverage Web-serial and essentially <em>require</em> that user's use Chrome (or Edge or Opera) was a calculated choice.  When your development team is 1 part-time person and the occasional few hours from another contractor here or there, you do what you can.  Developing an application/extension/client-agent was just not possible given our available resources.</p>
                    <h4>Web-serial + CircuitPython + Paste-mode = 💕</h4>
                    <p>Web-serial is a really cool technology.  It's an extension of Web-USB, and it allows any serial device (think Arduino, Micro:bit, Pi Pico, ESP32, etc.) to communicate directly with the Javascript on a web page.  It relies on promises and streams, but it's fairly easy to implement. <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/web-serial#0" target="_blank">Google created a really good primer on it here.</a></p>
                    <p>The second technology that makes this all work is Adafruit's <a href="https://circuitpython.org/" target="_blank">CircuitPython</a> - more specifically, the <a href="https://codewith.mu/en/tutorials/1.2/repl" target="_blank">REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop)</a>.</p>
                    <h5>Essentially, you can terminal into the serial device, type Python code right into the terminal, and when you press enter, it runs the code you just typed!</h5>
                    <p>We knew we wanted this to be kid-friendly, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly" target="_blank">Google's Blockly</a> is a great, open-source tool to help kids learn programming.  And you can get Blockly to generate nearly any kind of code you want - including Python.</p>
                    <p>The trick, then, was to get the Blockly generated code "typed" into the serial terminal (or more accurately, the serial stream). After banging my head on the table for a few days and obsessing over line breaks, carriage returns, and tabs - I decided to RTFM (read the effin' manual).</p>
                    <p>That's when I stumbled across <b>Paste Mode</b>.  You can find it in MicroPython's documentation <a href="https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/repl.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  CiruitPython is a fork of MicroPython, so they share many of the same core behaviors, paste-mode being one of them.  And that's what we needed to get this all to work!</p>
                    <h4>What it looks like in JavaScript</h4>
                    <p>This isn't all of it, but there are three important parts to the serial connection in the browser. This first part is what I could best describe as the handshake where the connection is established.  The things worth noting are the delays, which help make sure things don't talk over each other, and the use of ASCII 3, 4, and 5 (Control-C, Control-D, and Control-E).  These toggle the REPL and Paste Mode when done in the right order and at the appropriate time.</p>

                    <p>Sending a stream to the browser is something I worked with on Parallax's BlocklyProp, and I learned on that project that it's too easy for users to crush the browser with a massive stream of characters, which all but locks up the browser.</p>
                    <p>For Piper Make, I implemented a watchdog that monitors the stream's character rate, and if it's too high, it shuts down the connection and warns the user:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
async function readLoop() {

    // Used to track how frequently characters are received to prevent lock-ups and slow-downs
    let receiveTimestamp = performance.now();
    let receiveCounter = 0;

    while (true) {

        const { value, done } = await serialConnection.reader.read();

        if (value) {
            // buffer characters to watch for errors and count incoming characters
            serialConnection.buffer += value.replace(/[^>=\n\rEro:]*/g, '');
            receiveCounter += value.length;

            if (serialConnection.charRateCheck) {
                // calculate the number of characters received each millisecond.
                let timeNow = performance.now();
                let timeDifference = timeNow - receiveTimestamp;

                // check every second to see if too many characters are coming in
                if (timeDifference > 1000) {
                    let receiveFrequency = receiveCounter/timeDifference;

                    receiveTimestamp = timeNow;
                    receiveCounter = 0;
                    
                    // If too many characters are coming in (rate is too high), 
                    // close the connection before something really goes wrong and alert the user.
                    if (receiveFrequency > 5) {
                        serialConnection.overflowConnectionCloser('characters');
                    }
                }
            }

            // only display to the console when running
            if (serialConnection.currentState === 'RUNNING' || serialConnection.showVerbose) {
                term.display(value);
            }
        }

        if (done) {
            serialConnection.reader.releaseLock();
            setConnectionButtonsState(false);
            serialConnection.currentState = 'NONE';

                    <p>The next thing I implemented was a sort of "routing markup" within the serial stream sent from the Pi Pico to the browser.  This let us add commands where the Pico could trigger behaviors on browser.  This was how we implemented many of the features that already existed on the Piper Computer Kit.</p>
                    <p>We created commands such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>System: allows for reading firmware version, installed CircuitPython libraries to see if updates are necessary</li>
                        <li>Shout: displays large text promptly in the center of the screen</li>
                        <li>Sound: play sound clips or synthesized notes (using Tone.js)</li>
                        <li>Graph: display data in a graph</li>
                        <li>Digital View: shows the pin or LED state (digital or analog) in real-time:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/piper-make/digital-view.png"/>
                    <p>When a "marked" packet comes through the serial stream, instead of being sent to the terminal, the information is routed somewhere else depending on the command.  This allowed me to add a ton of features and interactivity to the platform.</p>
                    <p>Here's the code that makes that happen:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-javascript">

                    <h3>Story Mode - Where We are Going from Here</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://www.shreebose.com/">Shree</a> is one of Piper's founders and Piper's Co-CEO, and she's maintained a vision for Piper Make and Piper as a whole that our products will engage kiddos through the power of stories.  The Piper Computer Kit does a lot of that using Minecraft Raspberry Pi Edition.</p>
                    <h4>Piper Make's Missing Piece</h4>
                    <p>Piper Make is incredibly cool, but it is missing something.  <em>Immersing kids in the story.</em></p>
                    <p>Right before the winter holidays this past year, Shree asked if I could add something to the Getting Started tutorial of Piper Make: an immersive story element.</p>
                    <h4>Building a World</h4>
                    <p>Piper Make has always had a story: Piperbot (the lead character), is a robot that is sent by humans to explore Mars.  When Piperbot gets there, he meets Pip, a small mouse-like martian creature who helps Piperbot out on their adventures together on Mars.  It's a fun story and a neat way to tie everything together, but Piper Make wasn't <em>immersing</em> kids in that story.</p>
                    <p>The first lesson on both Piper Make and the original Piper Computer Kit asks the user to touch two wires together, and when they do, something happens.  On the Piper Computer Kit, the user sees a world and is able to move their character through it by touching the wires together. All that Piper Make did was explain electricity and show a GIF of current running through a wire.  Admittedly, not nearly as exciting.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of Piper Make's development, Piper commissioned a series of video clips to be used as intros and outros for each of the tutorials in Piper Make.  They showed kiddos the Piper Make world, but the goal was to bring them into that world.  So, just like on the Piper Computer Kit, we set out to create that world.</p>
                    <h4>Minecraft isn't an option</h4>
                    <p>Piper's branding is very Minecraft-like.  But, the Computer Kit can leverage the whole Raspberry Pi - Piper Make is restricted to the browser. And trademarks are a potentially expensive thing to mess with.</p>
                    <p>I was already familiar with <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a> from using it to develop simulations to teach science concepts.  I knew we could use it to generate the kind of immersive experience that we needed for Piper Make.  I also knew that we had worked with an animator/modeler who just might still have the 3D assets he used to create the original intro and outro videos, so we reached out to him.</p>
                    <h4>He did not have the files :(</h4>
                    <p>Go figure.  Video content can take up a TON of memory and disk space, so I do not blame him at all for deleting most of what he had done.</p>
                    <p>He was able to send us a few assets - not a lot, but enough for me to download <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> and go spelunking.</p>
                    <p>First off - mad props to all you 3D animators out there.  I respected what you did before, now I <em>really</em> respect what you do!  Next off, I figured a few things out.  I learned that you can export the things you create in Blender in GLTF format, and those files can be imported by Three.js (mostly). Additionally, I (more accurately, my daughter - yes she got paid for this) was able to use Minecraft: Education Edition (Piper has a relationship here through the Game Controller Kit) to build the buildings and environments, too.  Those models could then be exported and directly read by Three.js as well.</p>

                    <p>I'm really excited to begin this next chapter in Piper Make's story!</p>
