                    <h2>Garage Shelves</h2>
                    <p>Who couldn't use a little more storage?  A few years ago we moved in with family because they had some extra room and we were in-btween places and looking to same some money.  They had a 3-stall garage, but only used 1 of the stalls, and we were content to park on the street and use the remainder of the garage to store our things while we didn't have a house or apartment of our own.</p>
                    <p>I designed these shelves because they were strudy, big, and inexpensive compared to what I could purchase.  And, I could build them myself without help.</p>

                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>Here are the tools you will need:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Saw - A chop saw works best, but a table saw or skill saw will work</li>
                        <li>Drill/Driver - You will need this to pre-drill holes and screw in screws</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>#2 Phillips bit (or a bit to match the screws you use</li>
                                <li>1/8" drill bit.  A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DW2711-Replacement-Drill-Countersink/dp/B0000DD6M1/" target="_blank">countersinking bit</a> is even better</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Tape measure</li>
                        <li>Level or large square</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Materials</h3>
                    <p>You can purchase everything you need at Lowe's or Home Depot. In my experience, Lowe's has better grades of smaller-sized lumber that you'll need for this design.  Make sure that you take the time to select boards without cracks running down the lengths of the boards.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-3.png"/>
                    <p>After the lumber yard cuts your 4' &times; 8' sheet, it should look like this:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-4.png"/>
                    <p>In addition to the lumber, you will need decking or framing grade screws:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(~70) 3" long screws</li>
                        <li>(~120) 1&half;" long screws</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Building the Shelves</h3>
                    <h4>Shelf Platforms</h4>
                    <p>First, group your 2" &times; 3"s into three groups of 3.  In each group of three, cut one of the 2" &times; 3"s as shown:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-5.png"/>
                    <p>Attach the two 8' pieces to the 13" pieces as shown.  Use your tape measure to make sure they are evenly spaced.  The center board should be at the 4' from either end.  Use two 3" screws at each joint (where the arrows are pointing):</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-6.png"/>
                    <p>Attach one of the pieces of the cut up 4' &times; 8' sheet to the top.  Use 1&half;" screws to attach it where the arrows show:</p>
                    <p>Repeat this two more times to make three shelf platforms.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-7.png"/>
                    <p>On one of the platforms, attach the 3 16" pieces left from cutting the 2" &times; 3"s to the bottom.  Use 3" screws to attach them where the arrows show.</p>
                    <p>This is the bottom platform:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-8.png"/>
                    <h4>Uprights</h4>
                    <p>First, at least 8" off of the ends of the 10 1" &times; 2" boards.  You can cut more if you want the overal height of your shelf to be less than 88 inches.  The length of these boards determines the height of the completed shelves:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-11.png"/>
                    <p>Next, determine how much space you want between the bottom and middle shelf platforms.  Then, cut the six 2" &times; 2" boards to that length. (keep the remaining pieces - you'll need them in a future step).</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-10.png"/>
                    <p>Next, attach four of the 1" &times; 2" boards as shown.  <b>MAKE SURE YOU PRE-DRILL</b> holes into the 1" &times; 2" boards before you drive a screw into them!  They are thin enough to split easily. </p>
                    <p>Using 1&half;" screws, place one screw at each location shown by the arrows:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-9.png"/>
                    <p>Place a 2" &times; 2" board that you cut earlier into each corner as shown.</p>
                    <p>Making sure to pre-drill holes first, place 1&half;" screws at each location shown by the arrows:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-12.png"/>
                    <p>Lift and rest one of the shelf platforms onto the 2" &times; 2" boards.</p>
                    <p>Making sure to pre-drill holes first, place 1&half;" screws at each location shown by the arrows:</p>
                    <p><em>The shelf will be a bit wobbly, so use caution.</em></p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-13.png"/>
                    <p>Next, measure the distance between the top of the middle shelf platform to the top of the 1" &times; 2" boards:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-14a.png"/>
                    <p>Subtract 3 inches from your measurement.  This is how long you need to cut the 6 pieces of 2" &times; 2" that are left over from earlier:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-10.png"/>
                    <p>Place a 2" &times; 2" board that you just cut into each corner as shown.</p>
                    <p>Making sure to pre-drill holes first, place 1&half;" screws at each location shown by the arrows:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-14.png"/>
                    <p>Lift and rest one of the shelf platforms onto the 2" &times; 2" boards.</p>
                    <p>Making sure to pre-drill holes first, place 1&half;" screws at each location shown by the black arrows.</p>
                    <p>Then, using your remaining 1" &times; 2" and 2" &times; 2" boards, build and attach the center uprights as shown, and use 1&half;" screws at each location shown by the blue arrows.</p>
                    <p>Make sure you pre-drill holes first.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-15.png"/>
                    <h3>Braces</h3>
                    <p>The final step is to fit, cut, and install the four 1" &times; 4" baords as braces.</p>
                    <h4>Make sure it's square and level before you continue!</h4>
                    <p>The shelf will still be a bit flexible at this point.  You can use your level or square to check every side and corner to make sure it's level and square, and push it into place carefully as you go.</p>
                    <h5>Once it's level and square, measure and install the braces to lock it into place.</h5>
                    <p>Simply hold each board up, mark where and at what angle it needs to be cut, and then use your saw to make those cuts.</p>
                    <p>Making sure to pre-drill holes first, place two 1&half;" screws at each location shown by the arrows.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/garage-shelves/shelf-step-16.png"/>
                    <h4>That's it!</h4>
                    <h5>Make sure you attach these to a wall before loading them with stored goods!</h5>
                    <p>You can use the 3" screws to attach them, but make sure you anchor them properly into a stud or sufficiently large drywall anchor.</p>
                    <p>These shelves are too narrow to use as free-standing shelves, but, if you place two shelving units back-to-back and screw them together, then it is wide enough to be free-standing.</p>
