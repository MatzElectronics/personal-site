                    <h2>Spoofed Sensor Modules</h2>
                    <p>Just Google "Chip Shortage" and you'll find all kinds of articles about how there is still a shortage of semiconductors, especially in the automotive and consumer electronics industries.  The global shortages began before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the pandemic made the problem significantly worse.</p>
                    <h3>How Piper Learning was Affected</h3>
                    <p>Piper Learning's flagship product, the <a href="https://www.playpiper.com/pages/piper-computer-kit" target="_blank">Piper Computer Kit</a> uses a Rasperry Pi SBC (single-board computer).  The global shortage crushed the availability of the chips needed to make these SBCs, and it became increasingly difficult to source them.  That's a story all on it's own, but the impact of the shortages affected other products, too.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.playpiper.com/pages/piper-make" target="_blank">Piper Make</a> is the other main product line from Piper Learning.  It uses a Raspberry Pi microcontroller (as opposed to an SBC), and those microcontrollers actually had a really good supply built up before the shortage hit - unlike most semiconductors, they were and still are easy to source and don't seem to be impacted by the chip shortages.</p>
                    <h4>The Sensor Explorer Kit</h4>
                    <p>Piper Learning's most popular accessory is the <a href="https://www.playpiper.com/products/sensor-explorer" target="_blank">Sensor Explorer Kit</a>.  It works with both the Piper Computer Kit and Piper Make, and for that reason, it's a significant source of revenue for the company.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/piper-sensor-explorer.webp"/>
                    <p>The individual sensor modules in the Sensor Explorer Kit were sourced from Seeed Studio and are part of their Grove line of products.  at teh beginning of the pandemic, we were informed by Seeed that they wouldn't be able to fulfull parts of a large order we made with them.  We worked with them to try and figure out alternatives, but we quickly discovered that it wasn't going to be cost-effective to modify the Piper Computer Kit's software to work with different sensor modules.</p>
                    <h4>Taking Chances with PCBAs</h4>
                    <p>I already had experience designing a production-ready PCBA: the <a href="https://www.playpiper.com/products/piper-make-controller-kit" target="_blank">Piper Make Game Controller</a>.  Because that process was already set up, designing and building a proof-of-concept would only take a few weeks and would cost less than $1000, so moving forward with that crazy idea was geen-lit.  The idea was to use a small microcontroller like an ATtiny to act as an I<sup>2</sup>C device and spoof the API of the sensors we were not longer able to get.  To be honest, I thought it would be fun to explore the possibility, but I don't think I would succeed.</p>
                    <p>I was only able to source <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATtiny24A-44A-84A-DataSheet-DS40002269A.pdf" target="_blank">ATtiny24a</a> microcontrollers.  They run at up to 8Mhz and have 2Kbytes of flash memory.  They don't have hardware I<sup>2</sup>C, but they do have a hardware Universal Serial Interface that can be configured as an I<sup>2</sup>C connection.  And they have more than enough GPIO and 10-bit ADCs to do what we needed it to.</p>

                    <h3>Designing a Proof-of-Concept</h3>
                    <p>The first big hurdle was getting the ATtiny to behave as an I<sup>2</sup>C <em>device</em>.  This turned out to be no small feat, as a lot of the examples available show how to use the ATtiny as an I<sup>2</sup>C <em>controller</em>, and that's not what I needed for this project.</p>
                    <p>I finally found a working implementation (linked <a href="https://github.com/eriksl/usitwislave" target="_blank">here</a>).  Side note: I<sup>2</sup>C, SPI, and a few other things in computer science/elentrical engineering <a href="https://www.oshwa.org/a-resolution-to-redefine-spi-signal-names/" target="_blank">have some unfortunate histories and naming conventions</a>.  I'm not going to repeat them here and I feel that it is worth the effort to use more inclusive language.</p>
                    <p>Two of the three sensors in the Sensor Explorer kit needed some kind of replacement because of the ship shortages.  The first was the temperature sensor module, and the second was the color sensor module.  The new sensors would need to emulate the behavior of the originals, and they would need to do that be providing the correct data at each register address when asked by the microcontroller or computer that they are connected to.</p>

                    <h4>The Temperature Sensor Module</h4>
                    <p>The Seeed Studio Grove temperature sensor that was in the original Sensor Explorer kit uses an MCP9808 chip as it's temperature sensor.  As of early 2023, these chips are still very hard to source.  It's a high-precision thermometer and reading the temperature from the chip is relatively simple.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/grove-temp-sensor.jpg"/>
                    <p>I'm not going to dive into the specifics of how I<sup>2</sup>C works - there are a lot of great tutorials that have already been published that can do that better than I can.  What's important for this specific application is that I<sup>2</sup>C devices have a small bank of memory where things like configuration information and data are stored.  The I<sup>2</sup>C controller (microcontroller) can read or write to these memory addresses to do things like initialize the chip or read data from it.</p>
                    <p>This is the register map for the MCP9808 as shown in its <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/25095A.pdf">datasheet:</a></p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/mcp9808-registers.png"/>
                    <p>Using the imformation in that table, I created a small array in the code for the ATtiny.  Notice that the values are essentially identical where provided, and set to <b><code>0</code></b> where it's unknown or variable:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-c">
volatile uint16_t registers[9] = {
    0b0000000000011110,  // 0x00 Unused
    0b0000000000000000,  // 0x01 Config
    0b0000000000000000,  // 0x02 Upper "limit" temperature
    0b0000000000000000,  // 0x03 Lower "limit" temperature
    0b0000000000000000,  // 0x04 Critical "limit" temperature
    0b0000000110010000,  // 0x05 Measured temperature + flag bits
    0b0000000001010100,  // 0x06 Maufacturer ID
    0b0000010000000000,  // 0x07 Device ID and Revision number
    0b0000000000000011,  // 0x08 Sensor Resolution
};
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>The next thing I needed to know is which registers mattered to the libraries that would be reading them.  The MCP9808 has resiters for high- and low-temperature thresholds which can trigger alarms for interrupts when they are crossed.  The good news is that neither the Piper Computer Kit nor Piper Make used this feature, so it was safe to ignore it.</p>
                    <p>Here's the function on the Computer Kit that reads the MCP9808:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-rust">
mod registers {
    pub const DEFAULT_IIC_ADDR: u16 = 0x18;

    pub const AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE_ADDR: u8 = 0x05;
    pub const SET_RESOLUTION_ADDR: u8 = 0x08;
    pub const RESOLUTION_0_0625_DEGREE: u8 = 0x03;
}

use self::registers::*;

impl TempSensor {
    fn set_resolution(&mut self) -> Result<()> {

        // Initialize the temp sensor        
        // This just picks the highest resolution for now
        self.write(&[SET_RESOLUTION_ADDR, RESOLUTION_0_0625_DEGREE])
    }

    pub fn read_temperature(&mut self) -> Result<f32> {

        // Read the temperature sensor
        let raw = self.read_u16(AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE_ADDR)?;
        Ok(Self::normalise_temp(raw))
    }

    fn normalise_temp(value: u16) -> f32 {

        // Calcuate the temperature from the data in the register
        let mut tmp = (value & 0x0FFF) as f32 / 16.0;
        if (value & 0x1000) != 0 {
            tmp -= 256.0;
        }
        tmp
    }

    fn read_u16(&mut self, reg: u8) -> Result<u16> {

        // Read from the specified register
        self.write(&[reg])?;
        let mut buf: [u8; 2] = [0; 2];

        match self.handle.read(&mut buf) {
            Ok(_) => Ok(((buf[0] as u16) << 8) | buf[1] as u16),
            Err(_) => Err(HAL::Error::NotFound)
        }
    }
}
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>And here is the code that reads the MCP9808 in Piper Make:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">
_MCP9808_DEFAULT_ADDRESS = const(0x18)

        if not ok or self.buf[1] != 0x04:
            raise ValueError( "Unable to find MCP9808 at i2c address " + str(hex(address)) )

            i2c.write_then_readinto(self.buf, self.buf, out_end=1, in_start=1)

        return self._temp_conv()
                    </code></pre>             
                    <p>In fact, the only register that really matters to the Piper Computer Kit is register <b><code>0x05</code></b> - the measured temperature. And, the temperature is stored into that register the same way, regardless of the resolution setting.  Piper Make is similar - it only reads the <b><code>0x05</code></b> once the chip is initialized, but it does look at the manufacturer and device IDs in registers <b><code>0x06</code></b> and <b><code>0x07</code></b>.  Those are simple, hoever, because they just contain constant values.</p>
                    <h5>Measuring the Temperature</h5>
                    <p>Now that the ATtiny could emulate the MCP9808's registers, the next step was actually measuring the temperature.  The simplest and cheapest way to measure temperature is using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermistor" target="_blank">thermistor</a>. A thermistor is a special resistor whos resistance changes proportionally to changes in its temperature. I chose a thermistor based on a few factors: cost, availability, and measurment range.</p>
                    <p>The datasheet for the sensor I chose also had some helpful information:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/NTC-resistance-table.png"/>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the exact thermistor I chose wasn't represented in the table above - but one with exactly 10x less resistance was.  All I needed to do was multiply the values in the selected column by 10, and it would at least be close to what I needed.</p>
                    <h5>Using a Voltage Divider</h5>
                    <p>The ATtiny has several ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters).  These measure an analog <em>voltage</em>on a specified pins on the ATtiny.  Changing the <em>resistance</em> of the thermistor to a voltage can be done using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider">Voltage Divider</a>:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/voltagedivider.png"/>
                    <p>Since a voltage divider needs two resistors, I needed a fixed-value resistor to compare the thermistor to.  I picked a resistance roughly in the middle of the thermistor's range: 51 k&ohm;.  Once I had that value, I used the data from the table and the value of the second resistor to calculate a set of points to begin modeling the expected ADC values for any given temperature:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/adc-values-table.png"/>
                    <p>And once I had a set of points, I used the graphing calculator tool on <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" target="_blank">Desmos.com</a> to plot those points:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/data-points.png"/>
                    <p>As you can see above, it's a somewhat complex curve.  If you wanted to put a tendline to it, a cubic polynomial is close, but small microcontrollers like the ATtiny can't do floating point math quickly, and would struggle with even having to square values, let alone cube them.</p>
                    <p>It's a LOT faster to use several different linear approximations along the curve. With 5 lines, the output would stay within 1.5&deg;C everywhere along the curve:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/desmos-graph.png"/>
                    <p>The original MCP9808 chip is much more accurate, but since these are used for educational purposes, and the largest erros are at more extreeme temperatures, this is more than good enough. Implementing it in code was simple enough, and once the temperature was calcualted from the ADC value, it was then placed into the array at position <b><code>0x05</code></b> so that when the microcontroller reads that register, it is getting the measured temperature.</p>
                    <h4>The Color Sensor Module</h4>
                    <p>The Seeed Studio Grove color sensor that was in the original Sensor Explorer kit uses an TCS3472 chip as it's color sensor.  As of early 2022, these chips are designated as obsolete and are no longer anufactured.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/grove-temp-sensor.jpg"/>
                    <h5>How Color Sensing Works</h5>
                    <p>The Grove color sensor also contains an LED that emits a white light.  The TCS3472 chip then measures the red, green, and blue wavelengths that bounce back. Based on the amount of red, green, and blue light that bounces back, it can determine what color the sensor is looking at:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/color-sensor-how-it-works.svg"/>
                    <p>When I began researching how to replace this sensor, I started by looking at what chips were available, and there were several that measured color in a similar manner.  The problem was that none of them used the same I<sup>2</sup>C registers, and therefore wouldn't be compatible with the existing software on the Piper Computer Kit.</p>
                    <p><em>Usually, updating the software to support a hardware change is the cheaper and easier route - in this case, however, it really was not.  The code on the Piper Computer kit is notoriously difficult to edit, and it was actually easier (and in the long run far cheaper) to develop a compatible hardware replacement.</em></p>
                    <h5>A Slightly Different Way to Sense Color</h5>
                    <p>Parallax Inc. (who I worked for for several years) sells a color sensing module called the <a href="https://www.parallax.com/product/colorpal-color-sensor/" target="_blank">ColorPAL</a>.  Instead of using a sensor that can measure Red, Green, and Blue all at once, it illumiates the target being measured with red, green, and blue light separately and measures the reflected light with a single light sensor.</p>
                    <p>I used this approach when designing the replacement for the Grove color sensor.  I used an RGB LED and a single, high-sensitivity phototransistor to measure the light that was reflected. The beauty of using a phototransistor was that it could be used in a voltage divider and fed into one of the ATtiny's ADC inputs just like in the temperature sensor:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/sch-color-sensor.png"/>
                    <p>From there, just like in the temperature sensor, I just needed to place the Red, Green, and Blue light measurements into the appropriate registers, and both the Piper Computer and Piper Make were able to read the new sensor as if it was the original one.</p>
                    <h4>Prototype Hardware</h4>
                    <p>I needed a platform to confirm that this would work and to fine-tune the code that would be loaded onto the modules once we finalized them.  I wish I could show full schematics and gerber files, but the details are proprietary.  Here's a feature list that I can share:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Similar form factor to original sensor modules</li>
                        <li>Same 4-pin connector (this was a challenge to track down - it's not exactly the same as a JST connector)</li>
                        <li>Reverse-voltage protection using a p-channel MOSFET as an ideal diode</li>
                        <li>Level-shifting on the I<sup>2</sup>C lines based on Phillips <a href="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/an97055.pdf" target="_blank">Application Note 97055</a></li>
                        <li>Onboard voltage regulation</li>
                        <li>6-pin ICSP header for programming and debugging</li>
                        <li>For the final design, standardized panel sizing for automated programming and testing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/prototype-sensor.jpg"/>
                    <p>This prototype allowed me to finalize both the hardware and firmware for the replacement sensors, so the next step was getting approval and setting up production, programming, and testing.</p>
                    <h3>Producing the Sensors</h3>
                    <p>There isn't a lot I can say here - we have been using JLCPCB's fabrication and SMT services to produce panels of the replacement sensors.  We also use their inventory management to pre-purchase all of the necessary components as well.  JLCPCBs service has been good and their lead and shipping time of approximately 2-3 weeks has been very reasonable.</p>
                    <p>When we've ordered sensors, we've ordered upwards of 4000 sensors at a time.  I have them shipped to me, and I program and test them personally - at this point it's still more cost effective for me to complete those steps than to have the kitting staff at Piper's Headquarters do it.  Admittety, when they arrive, it's a strange feeling having a box with a retail value higher than the car in my driveway sitting on my front porch.</p>

                    <h3>Programming the Sensor Modules</h3>
                    <p>Because the replacement sensor modules use a generic microcontroller to spoof the chip they are menat to replace, each one needs to be programmed with firmware.  Programming a few is easy, programming thousands of them is another story.</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/module-programming.jpg"/>
                    <p>Sometimes, you have to follow the advice of Larry the Cable Guy and just "GIT 'ER DONE".  In this case, that meant abusing the ICSP specification to program more than one sensor at a time.</p>
                    <h4>Multi-programmers</h4>
                    <p>They do manufacture multi-programmers.  None of them were within the budget for this project.  For example, this multi-programmer is over $4000:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/softlog-multi.png"/>
                    <p>I'm not sure what inpried me to try this, but I thought about what each line of the ICSP (In-circuit serial programming) connection was doing:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>VCC:</b> Delivers power</li>
                        <li><b>GND:</b> Ground</li>
                        <li><b>RES:</b> Reset Line.  The programmer drives this line to ground to reset the target</li>
                        <li><b>CLK:</b> Clock Line. The programmer drives this line with clock pulses for the target to sync to</b></li>
                        <li><b>SDO:</b> Serial Data Out. The programmer drives this line to send data out to be written to the target</li>
                        <li><b>SDI:</b> Serial Data In. The programmer listens to this line as an input to verify what was written to the target</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I realized that every line is <b>driven</b> <em>except</em> the <b>SDI</b> line.  If I only connected the SDI line to <em>one</em> of the sensor modules, there wouldn't be any conflicts on that line.  Only the one sensor connected to that line would be verified after programming, but that didn't matter much since each module would be tested anyway:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/multi-programmer.png"/>
                    <p>I used an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Atmega32U4-Bootloadered-Development-Microcontroller/dp/B01MTU9GOB" target="_blank">Arduino Pro Micro clone</a> as an ICSP programmer, and with this circuit, it allowed me to program 4 sensors at a time - and since the panels were four modules wide, this sped the process up quite a bit:</p>

                    <h3>Testing the Modules</h3>
                    <p>Again, because a lot of the details are propritary, I can't share many of the specifics of the testers I built for the modules. I can share that I used several Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller modules loaded with fimrware from Piper Make to make sure that the test procedure would verify the new modules on the same hardware and software they would be used with.</p>
                    <p>I also had a few PCBs fabricated to hold pogo-pins to make quick connections to the ICSP headers on the modules being tested:</p>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/replacement-sensors/test-program-pcbs.jpg"/>
                    <p>The tester has a set of LEDs on it - it is yellow or blue when it's waiting to test or in the process of testing, and if the modules passes, it lights green.  If it fails, it lights red.</p>
                    <h4>Using a Robot</h4>
                    <p>Programming and testing the modules by hand didn't last long - in order to keep the cost of the modules down, it was worth investing in developing a method for automating it.  The process of developing that is it's own article, which is coming soon!</p>
